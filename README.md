# Figma Design to Fully Responsive Web Page Development

This project converts a Figma design into a fully responsive web page. The design has been carefully replicated to ensure that no detail is overlooked, and the web page is optimized for different screen sizes using CSS media queries. The project utilizes React, Chart.js, and other modern web development technologies.
